               Two-Round Threshold Signatures with FROST
                      draft-irtf-cfrg-frost-latest

Abstract

   In this draft, we present a two-round signing variant of FROST, a
   Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signature scheme.  FROST
   signatures can be issued after a threshold number of entities
   cooperate to issue a signature, allowing for improved distribution of
   trust and redundancy with respect to a secret key.  Further, this
   draft specifies signatures that are compatible with EdDSA
   verification of signatures.  However, this draft does not generate
   deterministic nonces as defined by EdDSA, to ensure protection
   against a key-recovery attack that is possible when even only one
   participant is malicious.

1.  Introduction

   DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress draft of FROST.

   RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH The source for this
   draft is maintained in GitHub.  Suggested changes should be submitted
   as pull requests at https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost.
   Instructions are on that page as well.

   Unlike signatures in a single-party setting, threshold signatures
   require cooperation among a threshold number of signers each holding
   a share of a common private key.  The security of threshold schemes
   in general assume that an adversary can corrupt strictly fewer than a
   threshold number of participants.

   In this draft, we present a variant of FROST, a Flexible Round-
   Optimized Schnorr Threshold signature scheme.  FROST reduces network
   overhead during threshold signing operations while employing a novel
   technique to protect against forgery attacks applicable to prior
   Schnorr-based threshold signature constructions.

   This draft specifies only two-round signing operations.  This draft
   specifies signatures that are compatible with EdDSA verification of
   signatures, but not EdDSA nonce generation.  EdDSA-style nonce-
   generation, where the nonce is derived deterministically, is insecure
   in a multi-party signature setting.

   Further, this draft implements signing efficiency improvements for
   FROST described by Crites, Komlo, and Maller in [Schnorr21].

2.  Change Log

   draft-01

   *  Submitted a draft that specifies operations, notation and
      cryptographic dependencies.

   draft-00

   *  Submitted a basic draft after adoption of draft-komlo-frost as a
      working group item.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Overview

   FROST is a threshold signature protocol involving the following
   parties:

   *  Signers: Entities with signing key shares that participate in the
      threshold signing protocol

   *  Coordinator: An entity responsible for performing coordination
      among signers and for aggregating signature shares at the end of
      the protocol, resulting in the final signature.  This party may be
      a signer themselves or an external party.

   FROST assumes the selection of all participants, including the
   dealer, signer, and Coordinator are all chosen external to the
   protocol.

   In FROST, Signers participate in two rounds to sign an input message
   and produce a single, aggregate signature.  All signers are assumed
   to have the group state and their corresponding signing keys; see
   Section 8 for details about how this state is generated.  At the end
   of the second round, the Coordinator performs an aggregation function
   to produce the final signature This is sketched below.

5.  Conventions and Terminology

   The following notation and terminology are used throughout this
   document.

   *  A participant is an entity that is trusted to hold a secret share.

   *  NUM_SIGNERS denotes the number of participants, and the number of
      shares that s is split into.  This value MUST NOT exceed 2^16-1.

   *  THRESHOLD_LIMIT denotes the threshold number of participants
      required to issue a signature.  More specifically, at least
      THRESHOLD_LIMIT shares must be combined to issue a valid
      signature.

   *  len(x) is the length of integer input x as an 8-byte, big-endian
      integer.

   *  I2OSP(x, w): Convert non-negative integer x to a w-length, big-
      endian byte string as described in [RFC8017].

   *  OS2IP(s): Convert byte string s to a non-negative integer as
      described in [RFC8017], assuming big-endian byte order.

   *  || denotes contatenation, i.e., x || y = xy.

   Unless otherwise stated, we assume that secrets are sampled uniformly
   at random using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number
   generator (CSPRNG); see [RFC4086] for additional guidance on the
   generation of random numbers.

   Let B be a generator, or distiguished element, of G, a finite group
   of with order l, a large prime.  Throughout this document, and in
   practice, we assume this group to be instantiated as an arbitrary
   abstraction of an elliptic curve subgroup, defined over a finite
   field; however, that does not restrict an implementation from
   instantiating FROST signatures over other groups, provided their
   order be prime.

   We denote group elements with capital Roman letters, and scalars with
   lower-cased Roman letters.  We use + to denote the group operation,
   and - to denote inversion.  We use * to denote multiplication of a
   scalar by a group element, that is, the group element added to itself
   in succession a number of times equal to the value of the scalar.
   Testing equality between two group elements is denoted as ?=, where
   it is assumed that the elements are in some canonical, serialised
   form.

6.  Cryptographic Dependencies

   FROST depends on the following cryptographic constructs:

   *  Prime-order Group, Section 6.1;

   *  Cryptographic hash function, Section 6.2;

   These are described in the following sections.

6.1.  Prime-Order Group

   FROST depends on an abelian group G of prime order p.  The
   fundamental group operation is addition + with identity element I.
   For any elements A and B of the group G, A + B = B + A is also a
   member of G.  Also, for any A in GG, there exists an element -A such
   that A + (-A) = (-A) + A = I.  Scalar multiplication is equivalent to
   the repeated application of the group operation on an element A with
   itself r-1 times, this is denoted as r*A = A + ... + A.  For any
   element A, p * A = I.  We denote B as the fixed generator of the
   group.  Scalar base multiplication is equivalent to the repeated
   application of the group operation B with itself r-1 times, this is
   denoted as ScalarBaseMult(r).  The set of scalars corresponds to
   GF(p), which refer to as the scalar field.  This document uses types
   Element and Scalar to denote elements of the group G and its set of
   scalars, respectively.  We denote equality comparison as == and
   assignment of values by =.

   We now detail a number of member functions that can be invoked on a
   prime-order group G.

   *  Order(): Outputs the order of G (i.e. p).

   *  Identity(): Outputs the identity element of the group (i.e.  I).

   *  RandomScalar(): A member function of G that chooses at random a
      non-zero element in GF(p).

   *  SerializeElement(A): A member function of G that maps a group
      element A to a unique byte array buf of fixed length Ne.  The
      output type of this function is SerializedElement.

   *  DeserializeElement(buf): A member function of G that maps a byte
      array buf to a group element A, or fails if the input is not a
      valid byte representation of an element.  This function can raise
      a DeserializeError if deserialization fails or A is the identity
      element of the group; see Section 6.1.1.

6.1.1.  Input Validation

   The DeserializeElement function recovers a group element from an
   arbitrary byte array.  This function validates that the element is a
   proper member of the group and is not the identity element, and
   returns an error if either condition is not met.

   For ristretto255, elements are deserialized by invoking the Decode
   function from [RISTRETTO], Section 4.3.1, which returns false if the
   element is invalid.  If this function returns false, deserialization
   returns an error.

   The DeserializeScalar function recovers a scalar field element from
   an arbitrary byte array.  Like DeserializeElement, this function
   validates that the element is a member of the scalar field and
   returns an error if this condition is not met.

   For ristretto255, this function ensures that the input, when treated
   as a little-endian integer, is a value greater than or equal to 0,
   and less than Order().

6.2.  Cryptographic Hash Function

   FROST requires the use of a cryptographically secure hash function,
   generically written as H, which functions effectively as a random
   oracle.  For concrete recommendations on hash functions which SHOULD
   BE used in practice, see Section 9.  Using H, we introduce three
   separate domain-separated hashes, H1, H2, and H3, where H1 and H2 map
   arbitrary inputs to non-zero Scalar elements of the prime-order group
   scalar field, and H3 is an alias for H with domain separation
   applied.  The details of H1, H2, and H3 vary based on ciphersuite.
   See Section 9 for more details about each.

7.  Helper functions

   Beyond the core dependencies, the protocol in this document depends
   on the following helper operations:

   *  Schnorr signatures, Section 7.1;

   *  Polynomial operations, Section 7.2;

   *  Encoding operations, Section 7.3

   This sections describes these operations in more detail.

7.1.  Schnorr Signature Operations

   In the single-party setting, a Schnorr signature is generated with
   the following operation.

  schnorr_signature_generate(msg, SK):

  Inputs:
  - msg, message to be signed, an octet string
  - SK, private key, a scalar
  - PK, public key, a group element

  Outputs: signature (R, z), a pair of scalar values

  def schnorr_signature_generate(msg, SK, PK):
    r = G.RandomScalar()
    R = G.ScalarBaseMult(r)

    msg_hash = H3(msg)
    comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
    pk_enc = G.SerializeElement(PK)
    challenge_input = group_comm_enc || group_public_key_enc || msg_hash
    c = H2(challenge_input)

    z = r + (c * SK)
    return (R, z)

   The corresponding verification operation is as follows.

  schnorr_signature_verify(msg, sig, PK):

  Inputs:
  - msg, signed message, an octet string
  - sig, a tuple (R, z) output from schnorr_signature_generate or FROST
  - PK, public key, a group element

  Outputs: 1 if signature is valid, and 0 otherwise

  def schnorr_signature_verify(msg, sig = (R, z), PK):
    msg_hash = H3(msg)
    comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
    pk_enc = G.SerializeElement(PK)
    challenge_input = group_comm_enc || group_public_key_enc || msg_hash
    c = H2(challenge_input)

    l = ScalarBaseMult(z)
    r = R + (c * PK)
    if l == r:
      return 1
    return 0

7.2.  Polynomial Operations

   This section describes operations on and associated with polynomials
   that are used in the main signing protocol.  A polynomial of degree t
   is represented as a sorted list of t coefficients.  A point on the
   polynomial is a tuple (x, y), where y = f(x).  For notational
   convenience, we refer to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a point
   p as p.x and p.y, respectively.

7.2.1.  Evaluation of a polynomial

   This section describes a method for evaluating a polynomial f at a
   particular input x, i.e., y = f(x) using Horner's method.

     polynomial_evaluate(x, coeffs):

     Inputs:
     - x, input at which to evaluate the polynomial, a scalar
     - coeffs, the polynomial coefficients, a list of scalars

     Outputs: Scalar result of the polynomial evaluated at input x

     def polynomial_evaluate(x, coeffs):
       value = 0
       for (counter, coeff) in coeffs.reverse():
         if counter == coeffs.len() - 1:
           value += coeff // add the constant term
         else:
           value += coeff
           value *= x

       return value

7.2.2.  Lagrange coefficients

   Lagrange coefficients are used in FROST to evaluate a polynomial f at
   f(0), given a set of t other points, where f is represented as a set
   of coefficients.

     derive_lagrange_coefficient(i, L):

     Inputs:
     - i, an index contained in L, a scalar
     - L, the set of x-coordinates, each a scalar

     Outputs: L_i, the i-th Lagrange coefficient

     def derive_lagrange_coefficient(i, L):
       numerator = 1
       denominator = 1
       for j in L:
         if j == i: continue
         numerator *= j
         denominator *= j - i

       L_i = numerator / denominator
       return L_i

7.2.3.  Deriving the constant term of a polynomial

   Secret sharing requires "splitting" a secret, which is represented as
   a constant term of some polynomial f of degree t.  Recovering the
   constant term occurs with a set of t points using polynomial
   interpolation, defined as follows.

    Inputs:
    - points, a set of `t` points on a polynomial f, each a tuple of two
      scalar values representing the x and y coordinates

    Outputs: The constant term of f, i.e., f(0)

    def polynomial_interpolation(points):
      L = []
      for point in points:
        L.append(point.x)

      f_zero = F(0)
      for point in points:
        delta = point.y * derive_lagrange_coefficient(point.x, L)
        f_zero = f_zero + delta

      return f_zero

7.3.  Encoding Operations

   This section describes various helper functions used for encoding
   data structures into values that can be processed with hash
   functions.

  Inputs:
  - commitment_list = [(i, x_i, y_i), ...], a list of commitments issued by each signer,
    where each element in the list indicates the signer index i and their
    two commitment Element values (x_i, y_i). This list MUST be sorted in ascending order
    by signer index.

  Outputs: A byte string containing the serialized representation of commitment_list.

  def encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list):
    encoded_group_commitment = nil
    for (index, hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
      encoded_commitment = I2OSP(index, 2) ||
                           G.SerializeElement(hiding_nonce_commitment) ||
                           G.SerializeElement(binding_nonce_commitment)
      encoded_group_commitment = encoded_group_commitment || encoded_commitment
    return encoded_group_commitment

8.  Two-Round FROST

   The FROST protocol produces a standard Schnorr signature over an
   input message of at most 2^16-1 bytes long.  The protocol assumes
   that each participant P_i knows the following:

   *  Group public key, denoted PK = G.ScalarMultBase(s), corresponding
      to the group secret key s.

   *  Participant i signing key, which is the i-th secret share of s.

   The exact key generation mechanism is out of scope for this
   specification.  In general, key generation is a protocol that outputs
   (1) a shared, group public key PK owned by each Signer, and (2)
   individual shares of the signing key owned by each Signer.  In
   general, two possible key generation mechanisms are possible, one
   that requires a single, trusted dealer, and the other which requires
   performing a distributed key generation protocol.  We highlight key
   generation mechanism by a trusted dealer in Appendix B, for
   reference.

   FROST assumes the existence of a _Coordinator_, which is a Signer
   responsible for the following:

   1.  Determining which signers will participate (at least
       THRESHOLD_LIMIT in number);

   2.  Coordinating rounds (receiving and forwarding inputs among
       participants); and

   3.  Aggregating signature shares output by each participant, and
       publishing the resulting signature.

   Selection of the Coordinator is outside the scope of this
   specification.

   We describe the protocol in two rounds: commitment and signing.  The
   first round serves for each participant to issue a commitment.  The
   second round receives commitments for all signers as well as the
   message, and issues a signature share.  The Coordinator performs the
   coordination of each of these rounds.  The Coordinator then performs
   an aggregation round at the end and outputs the final signature.

   This protocol assumes reliable message delivery between Coordinator
   and signing participants in order for the protocol to complete.
   Messages exchanged during signing operations are all within the
   public domain.  An attacker masquerading as another participant will
   result only in an invalid signature; see Section 10.

8.1.  Round One - Commitment

   Round one involves each signer generating a pair of nonces and their
   corresponding public commitments.  A nonce is a pair of Scalar
   values, and a commitment is a pair of Element values.

   Each signer in round one generates a nonce nonce = (hiding_nonce,
   binding_nonce) and commitment comm = (hiding_nonce_commitment,
   binding_nonce_commitment).

    Inputs: None

    Outputs: (nonce, comm), a tuple of nonce and nonce commitment pairs.

    def commit():
      hiding_nonce = G.RandomScalar()
      binding_nonce = G.RandomScalar()
      hiding_nonce_commitment = G.ScalarBaseMult(hiding_nonce)
      binding_nonce_commitment = G.ScalarBaseMult(binding_nonce)
      nonce = (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce)
      comm = (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)
      return (nonce, comm)

   The private output nonce from Participant P_i is stored locally and
   kept private for use in the second round.  The public output comm
   from Participant P_i is sent to the Coordinator; see Appendix C.1 for

8.2.  Round Two - Signature Share Generation

   In round two, the Coordinator is responsible for sending the message
   to be signed, and for choosing which signers will participate (of
   number at least THRESHOLD_LIMIT).  Signers additionally require
   locally held data; specifically, their private key and the nonces
   corresponding to their commitment issued in round one.

   The Coordinator begins by sending each signer the message to be
   signed along with the set of signing commitments for other signers in
   the participant list.  Upon receipt, each Signer then runs the
   following procedure to produce its own signature share.

  Inputs:
  - index, Index `i` of the signer. Note index will never equal `0`.
  - sk_i, Signer secret key share.
  - group_public_key, public key corresponding to the signer secret key share.
  - nonce_i, pair of Scalar values (d, e) generated in round one.
  - comm_i, pair of Element values (D, E) generated in round one.
  - msg, the message to be signed (sent by the Coordinator).
  - commitment_list = [(j, x_j, y_j), ...], a list of commitments issued by each signer,
    where each element in the list indicates the signer index j and their
    two commitment Element values (x_j, y_j). This list MUST be sorted in ascending order
    by signer index.
  - participant_list, a set containing identifiers for each signer, similarly of length
    NUM_SIGNERS (sent by the Coordinator).

  Outputs: a signature share sig_share and commitment share comm_share, which
           are Scalar and Element values respectively.

  def sign(index, sk, group_public_key, nonce, comm, msg, commitment_list, participant_list):
    # Compute the binding factor
    encoded_commitments = encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list)
    msg_hash = H3(msg)
    binding_factor = H1(encoded_commitments || msg_hash)

    # Compute the group commitment
    R = G.Identity()
    for (_, hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
      R = R + (hiding_nonce_commitment + (binding_nonce_commitment * binding_factor))

    lambda_i = derive_lagrange_coefficient(index, participant_list)

    # Compute the per-message challenge
    msg_hash = H3(msg)
    group_comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
    group_public_key_enc = G.SerializeElement(group_public_key)
    challenge_input = group_comm_enc || group_public_key_enc || msg_hash
    c = H2(challenge_input)

    # Compute the signature share
    (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce) = nonce_i
    sig_share = hiding_nonce + (binding_nonce * binding_factor) + (lambda_i * sk_i * c)

    # Compute the commitment share
    (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) = comm_i
    comm_share = hiding_nonce_commitment + (binding_nonce_commitment * binding_factor)

    return sig_share, comm_share

   The output of this procedure is a signature share and group
   commitment share.  Each signer then sends these shares back to the
   collector; see Appendix C.3 for encoding recommendations.

   The Coordinator MUST verify the set of signature shares using the
   following procedure.

  Inputs:
  - index, Index `i` of the signer. Note index will never equal `0`.
  - PK, the public key for the group
  - PK_i, the public key for the ith signer, where PK_i = ScalarBaseMult(s[i])
  - sig_share, the signature share for the ith signer, computed from the signer
  - comm_share, the commitment for the ith signer, computed from the signer
  - R, the group commitment
  - msg, the message to be signed
  - participant_list, a set containing identifiers for each signer, similarly of length
    NUM_SIGNERS (sent by the Coordinator).

  Outputs: 1 if the signature share is valid, and 0 otherwise.

  def verify_signature_share(index, PK, PK_i, sig_share, comm_share, R, msg, participant_list):
    msg_hash = H3(msg)
    group_comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
    group_public_key_enc = G.SerializeElement(group_public_key)
    challenge_input = group_comm_enc || group_public_key_enc || msg_hash
    c = H2(challenge_input)

    l = G.ScalarbaseMult(sig_share)

    lambda_i = derive_lagrange_coefficient(index, participant_list)
    r = comm_share + (sig_share * c * lambda_i)

    return l == r

8.3.  Signature Share Aggregation

   After signers perform round two and send their signature shares to
   the Coordinator, the Coordinator performs the aggregate operation and
   publishes the resulting signature.  Note that here we do not specify
   the Coordinator as validating each signature schare, as if any
   signature share is invalid, the resulting joint signature will
   similarly be invalid.  Deployments that wish to validate signature
   shares can do so using the verify_signature_share function in
   Section 8.2

  Inputs:
  - R: the group commitment.
  - sig_shares: a set of signature shares z_i for each signer, of length NUM_SIGNERS,
  where THRESHOLD_LIMIT <= NUM_SIGNERS <= MAX_SIGNERS.

  Outputs: (R, z), a Schnorr signature consisting of an Element and Scalar value.

  def frost_aggregate(R, sig_shares):
    z = 0
    for z_i in sig_shares:
      z = z + z_i
    return (R, z)

9.  Ciphersuites

   A FROST ciphersuite must specify the underlying prime-order group
   details and cryptographic hash function.  Each ciphersuite is denoted
   as (Group, Hash), e.g., (ristretto255, SHA-512).  This section
   contains some ciphersuites.  The RECOMMENDED ciphersuite is
   (ristretto255, SHA-512) Section 9.2.  The (edwards25519, SHA-512)
   ciphersuite is included for backwards compatibility with [RFC8032].

9.1.  FROST(edwards25519, SHA-512)

   This ciphersuite uses edwards25519 for the Group and SHA-512 for the
   Hash function H meant to produce signatures indistinguishable from
   Ed25519 as specified in [RFC8032].  The value of the contextString
   parameter is empty.

   *  Group: ed25519 [RFC8032]

      -  SerializeElement: Implemented as specified in [RFC8032],
         Section 5.1.2.

      -  DeserializeElement: Implemented as specified in [RFC8032],
         Section 5.1.3.

   *  Hash (H): SHA-512, and Nh = 64.

      -  H1(m): Implemented by computing H("rho" || m), interpreting the
         lower 32 bytes as a little-endian integer, and reducing the
         resulting integer modulo L =
         2^252+27742317777372353535851937790883648493.

      -  H2(m): Implemented by computing H(m), interpreting the lower 32
         bytes as a little-endian integer, and reducing the resulting
         integer modulo L =
         2^252+27742317777372353535851937790883648493.

      -  H3(m): Implemented as an alias for H, i.e., H(m).

   Normally H2 would also include a domain separator, but for backwards
   compatibility with [RFC8032], it is omitted.

9.2.  FROST(ristretto255, SHA-512)

   This ciphersuite uses ristretto255 for the Group and SHA-512 for the
   Hash function H.  The value of the contextString parameter is "FROST-
   RISTRETTO255-SHA512".

   *  Group: ristretto255 [RISTRETTO]

      -  SerializeElement: Implemented using the 'Encode' function from
         [RISTRETTO].

      -  DeserializElement: Implemented using the 'Decode' function from
         [RISTRETTO].

   *  Hash (H): SHA-512, and Nh = 64.

      -  H1(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString || "rho" || m)
         and mapping the the output to a Scalar as described in
         [RISTRETTO], Section 4.4.

      -  H2(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString || "chal" || m)
         and mapping the the output to a Scalar as described in
         [RISTRETTO], Section 4.4.

      -  H3(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString || "digest" ||
         m).

9.3.  FROST(P-256, SHA-256)

   This ciphersuite uses P-256 for the Group and SHA-256 for the Hash
   function H.  The value of the contextString parameter is "FROST-
   P256-SHA256".

   *  Group: P-256 (secp256r1) [x9.62]

      -  SerializeElement: Implemented using the compressed Elliptic-
         Curve-Point-to-Octet-String method according to [SECG].

      -  DeserializeElement: Implemented by attempting to deserialize a
         public key using the compressed Octet-String-to-Elliptic-Curve-
         Point method according to [SECG], and then performs partial
         public-key validation as defined in section 5.6.2.3.4 of
         [KEYAGREEMENT].

      -  Serialization: Elements are serialized as Ne = 33 byte string

   *  Hash (H): SHA-256, and Nh = 32.

      -  H1(m): Implemented using hash_to_field from [HASH-TO-CURVE],
         Section 5.3 using L = 48, expand_message_xmd with SHA-256, DST
         = contextString || "rho", and prime modulus equal to Order().

      -  H2(m): Implemented using hash_to_field from [HASH-TO-CURVE],
         Section 5.3 using L = 48, expand_message_xmd with SHA-256, DST
         = contextString || "chal", and prime modulus equal to Order().

      -  H3(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString || "digest" ||
         m).

10.  Security Considerations

   A security analysis of FROST exists in [FROST20].  The protocol as
   specified in this document assumes the following threat model.

   *  Trusted dealer.  The dealer that performs key generation is
      trusted to follow the protocol, although participants still are
      able to verify the consistency of their shares via a VSS
      (verifiable secret sharing) step; see Appendix B.2.

   *  Unforgeability assuming less than (t-1) corrupted signers.  So
      long as an adverary corrupts fewer than (t-1) participants, the
      scheme remains secure against EUF-CMA attacks.

   *  Coordinator.  We assume the Coordinator at the time of signing
      does not perform a denial of service attack.  A denial of service
      would include any action which either prevents the protocol from
      completing or causing the resulting signature to be invalid.  Such
      actions for the latter include sending inconsistent values to
      signing participants, such as messages or the set of individual
      commitments.  Note that the Coordinator is _not_ trusted with any
      private information and communication at the time of signing can
      be performed over a public but reliable channel.

   The rest of this section documents issues particular to
   implementations or deployments.

10.1.  Nonce Reuse Attacks

   Nonces generated by each participant in the first round of signing
   must be sampled uniformly at random and cannot be derived from some
   determinstic function.  This is to avoid replay attacks initiated by
   other signers, which allows for a complete key-recovery attack.
   Coordinates MAY further hedge against nonce reuse attacks by tracking
   signer nonce commitments used for a given group key, at the cost of
   additional state.

10.2.  Protocol Failures

   We do not specify what implementations should do when the protocol
   fails, other than requiring that the protocol abort.  Examples of
   viable failure include when a verification check returns invalid or
   if the underlying transport failed to deliver the required messages.

10.3.  External Requirements / Non-Goals

   FROST does not target the following goals.

   *  Post quantum security.  FROST requires the hardness of the
      Discrete Logarithm Problem.

   *  Robustness.  In the case of failure, FROST requires aborting the
      protocol.

   *  Downgrade prevention.  The sender and receiver are assumed to
      agree on what algorithms to use.

   *  Metadata protection.  If protection for metadata is desired, a
      higher-level communication channel can be used to facilitate key
      generation and signing.

11.  Removing the Coordinator Role

   In some settings, it may be desirable to omit the role of the
   coordinator entirely.  Doing so does not change the security
   implications of FROST, but instead simply requires each participant
   to communicate with all other participants.  We loosely describe how
   to perform FROST signing among signers without this coordinator role.
   We assume that every participant receives as input from an external
   source the message to be signed prior to performing the protocol.

   Every participant begins by performing frost_commit() as is done in
   the setting where a coordinator is used.  However, instead of sending
   the commitment SigningCommitment to the coordinator, every
   participant instead will publish this commitment to every other
   participant.  Then, in the second round, instead of receiving a
   SigningPackage from the coordinator, signers will already have
   sufficient information to perform signing.  They will directly
   perform frost_sign.  All participants will then publish a
   SignatureShare to one another.  After having received all signature
   shares from all other signers, each signer will then perform
   frost_verify and then frost_aggregate directly.

   The requirements for the underlying network channel remain the same
   in the setting where all participants play the role of the
   coordinator, in that all messages that are exchanged are public and
   so the channel simply must be reliable.  However, in the setting that
   a player attempts to split the view of all other players by sending
   disjoint values to a subset of players, the signing operation will
   output an invalid signature.  To avoid this denial of service,
   implementations may wish to define a mechanism where messages are
   authenticated, so that cheating players can be identified and
   excluded.

Appendix A.  Acknowledgments

   The Zcash Foundation engineering team designed a serialization format
   for FROST messages which we employ a slightly adapted version here.

Appendix B.  Trusted Dealer Key Generation

   One possible key generation mechanism is to depend on a trusted
   dealer, wherein the dealer generates a group secret s uniformly at
   random and uses Shamir and Verifiable Secret Sharing as described in
   Sections Appendix B.1 and Appendix B.2 to create secret shares of s
   to be sent to all other participants.  We highlight at a high level
   how this operation can be performed.

     Inputs:
     - n, the number of shares to generate, an integer
     - t, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer

     Outputs: a secret key Scalar, public key Element, along with `n`
     shares of the secret key, each a Scalar value.

     def trusted_dealer_keygen(n, t):
       secret_key = G.RandomScalar()
       secret_key_shares = secret_share_split(secret_key, n, t)
       public_key = G.ScalarBaseMult(s)
       return secret_key, public_key, secret_key_shares

   It is assumed the dealer then sends one secret key to each of the
   NUM_SIGNERS participants, and afterwards deletes the secrets from
   their local device.

   Use of this method for key generation requires a mutually
   authenticated secure channel between Coordinator and participants,
   wherein the channel provides confidentiality and integrity.  Mutually
   authenticated TLS is one possible deployment option.

B.1.  Shamir Secret Sharing

   In Shamir secret sharing, a dealer distributes a secret s to n
   participants in such a way that any cooperating subset of t
   participants can recover the secret.  There are two basic steps in
   this scheme: (1) splitting a secret into multiple shares, and (2)
   combining shares to reveal the resulting secret.

   This secret sharing scheme works over any field F.  In this
   specification, F is the scalar field of the prime-order group G.

   The procedure for splitting a secret into shares is as follows.

    secret_share_split(s, n, t):

    Inputs:
    - s, secret to be shared, an element of F
    - n, the number of shares to generate, an integer
    - t, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer

    Outputs: A list of n secret shares, each of which is an element of F

    Errors:
    - "invalid parameters", if t > n

    def secret_share(s, n, t):
      if t > n:
        raise "invalid parameters"

      # Generate random coefficients for the polynomial, yielding
      # a polynomial of degree (t - 1)
      coefficients = [s]
      for i in range(t - 1):
        coefficients.append(RandomScalar())

      # Evaluate the polynomial for each point x=1,...,n
      points = []
      for x_i in range(1, n+1):
        y_i = polynomial_evaluate(x_i, coefficients)
        point_i = (x_i, y_i)
        points.append(point_i)
      return points

   Let points be the output of this function.  The i-th element in
   points is the share for the i-th participant, which is the randomly
   generated polynomial evaluated at coordinate i.  We denote a secret
   share as the tuple (i, points[i]), and the list of these shares as
   shares. i MUST never equal 0.

   The procedure for combining a shares list of length t to recover the
   secret s is as follows.

    secret_share_combine(shares):

    Inputs:
    - shares, a list of t secret shares, each a tuple (i, f(i))

    Outputs: A list of n secret shares, each of which is an element of F

    Errors:
    - "invalid parameters", if less than t input shares are provided

    def secret_share_combine(shares):
      if len(shares) < t:
        raise "invalid parameters"
      s = polynomial_interpolation(shares)
      return s

B.2.  Verifiable Secret Sharing

   Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) builds upon Shamir secret
   sharing, adding a verification step to demonstrate the consistency of
   a participant's share with a public commitment to the polynomial f
   for which the secret s is the constant term.  This check ensure that
   all participants have a point (their share) on the same polynomial,
   ensuring that they can later reconstruct the correct secret.  If the
   validation fails, the participant can issue a complaint against the
   dealer, and take actions such as broadcasting this complaint to all
   other participants.  We do not specify the complaint procedure in
   this draft, as it will be implementation-specific.

   The procedure for committing to a polynomial f of degree t-1 is as
   follows.

    vss_commit(coeffs):

    Inputs:
    - coeffs, a vector of the t coefficients which uniquely determine
    a polynomial f.

    Outputs: a commitment C, which is a vector commitment to each of the
    coefficients in coeffs.

    def vss_commit(coeffs):
      C = []
      for coeff in coeffs:
        A_i = ScalarBaseMult(coeff)
        C.append(A_i)
      return C

   The procedure for verification of a participant's share is as
   follows.

     vss_verify(sk_i, C):

     Inputs:
     - sk_i: A participant's secret key, the tuple sk_i = (i, s[i]),
     where s[i] is a secret share of the constant term of f.
     - C: A VSS commitment to a secret polynomial f.

     Outputs: 1 if s[i] is valid, and 0 otherwise

     vss_verify(sk_i, commitment)
       S_i = ScalarBaseMult(s[i])
       S_i' = SUM(commitment[0], commitment[t-1]){A_j}: A_j*(i^j)
       if S_i == S_i':
         return 1
       return 0

Appendix C.  Wire Format

   Applications are responsible for encoding protocol messages between
   peers.  This section contains RECOMMENDED encodings for different
   protocol messages as described in Section 8.

C.1.  Signing Commitment

   A commitment from a signer is a pair of Element values.  It can be
   encoded in the following manner.

     SignerID uint64;

     struct {
       SignerID id;
       opaque D[Ne];
       opaque E[Ne];
     } SigningCommitment;

   id  The SignerID.

   D  The commitment hiding factor encoded as a serialized group
      element.

   E  The commitment binding factor encoded as a serialized group
      element.

C.2.  Signing Packages

   The Coordinator sends "signing packages" to each Signer in Round two.
   Each package contains the list of signing commitments generated
   during round one along with the message to sign.  This package can be
   encoded in the following manner.

   struct {
     SigningCommitment signing_commitments<1..2^16-1>;
     opaque msg<0..2^16-1>;
   } SigningPackage;

   signing_commitments  An list of SIGNING_COUNT SigningCommitment
      values, where THRESHOLD_LIIMT <= SIGNING_COUNT <= NUM_SIGNERS,
      ordered in ascending order by SigningCommitment.id.  This list
      MUST NOT contain more than one SigningCommitment value
      corresponding to each signer.  Signers MUST ignore SigningPackage
      values with duplicate SignerIDs.

   msg  The message to be signed.

C.3.  Signature Share

   The output of each signer is a signature share which is sent to the
   Coordinator.  This can be constructed as follows.

     struct {
       SignerID id;
       opaque signature_share[Ns];
       opaque commitment_share[Ne];
     } SignatureShare;

   id  The SignerID.

   signature_share  The signature share from this signer encoded as a
      serialized scalar.
